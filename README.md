# CPRO-2221-Assignment-2-SOLID-Principles

## What This Is
This is a project where I show how three SOLID principles can be broken and then fixed. The principles I picked are:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

## The Example I am Using
I’m using a **Library Management System** for this project. It’s a simple system where:
- You can add books to the library.
- Users can borrow books.
- The system sends notifications when books are due or unavailable.

I am showing examples of code that break these principles and how I fixed them to follow SOLID principles.

## How This Is Organized
- In the `Violated/` folder, I wrote code that does not follow the principles. These are the "bad examples."
- In the `Solved/` folder, I fixed the code to solve the issues. These are the "good examples."

## Why This Matters
SOLID principles are important because they make code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
